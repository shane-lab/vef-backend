  "description": "The VEF (Video Embedded Feedback) tool is a tool that helps teachers in the process of providing students with feedback on live performances such as presentations or demonstrations. The idea is that these performances will be recorded and that feedback information is linked to the recording (embedded in the video). Teachers preferably provide feedback with a mobile device like a smart phone or tablet, either real time or afterwards. After publishing, a student can watch the recording of his/her performance with the feedback of all assessors. ",
